Human-machine interface (HMI) is an important part of robotics, that allows to create human-friendly robotic systems. HMI synthesis may require some data, confirming whether there’re people in robotic system’s area. In order to provide the data tasks of face detection and its expression analysis have be solved. Since some robotic systems can be fast enough, the main challenge is to provide short time of detection and analysis processes in order to make face tracking most efficient.

Face detection is a crucial first step in many facial recognition and face analysis systems, Early approaches for face detection were mainly based on classifiers built on top of hand-crafted features extracted from local image regions, such as Haar Cascades and Histogram of Oriented Gradients.
Moreover, face expressions are natural and direct means for human beings to communicate their emotions and intentions. Face expressions are the key characteristics of non-verbal communication.
